# Dijkstra.
Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the
 shortest path between a given node
 (which is called the "source node") 
and all other nodes in a graph. 
This algorithm uses the weights of 
the edges to find the path that 
minimizes the total distance (weight)
between the source node and all other nodes.
